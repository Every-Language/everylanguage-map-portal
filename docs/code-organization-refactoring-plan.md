# Code Organization Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan to transition the codebase from a page-centric architecture to a feature-first organization, improving maintainability, reusability, and separation of concerns.

## Current Issues

### 1. Page Components Have Too Many Responsibilities
- **State Management**: Filter state, selection state, modal state, form state
- **Business Logic**: CRUD operations, data transformations, status management
- **UI Logic**: Rendering, event handling, validation
- **Data Fetching**: Multiple hooks and queries mixed with UI logic

### 2. Repeated Patterns Across Pages
- **Filter Management**: Similar filter state and handlers in `AudioFilesPage`, `BibleTextPage`, `ImagesPage`, `UsersPage`, `CommunityCheckPage`
- **Selection Logic**: Bulk selection with checkboxes and bulk operations
- **Sorting Logic**: Sort state and handlers
- **Modal Management**: Multiple boolean states for different modals
- **Status Updates**: Individual and batch status change operations
- **Form State**: Edit forms with similar patterns

### 3. Missing Feature Boundaries
- Bible content management scattered across multiple pages
- Media file management mixed with other concerns
- User management not properly encapsulated
- Community checking functionality not organized as a feature

## Target Architecture
