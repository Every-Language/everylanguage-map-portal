## Database Schema Integration

### Key Tables Used:
- `projects` - Project metadata
- `language_entities` - Hierarchical language structure
- `regions` - Hierarchical region structure
- `bible_versions` - Bible version references
- `books` - Bible book structure
- `chapters` - Chapter information with verse counts
- `verses` - Individual verse records
- `media_files` - Audio file metadata
- `media_files_verses` - Verse timing information
- `media_files_targets` - Chapter associations
- `text_versions` - Text version metadata
- `verse_texts` - Verse text content

### API Endpoints (Supabase Edge Functions):
- `upload_audio` - Handles audio file upload and processing
- `create_project` - Project creation with validation
- `extract_metadata` - Audio metadata extraction
- `bulk_text_upload` - CSV text processing

## Performance Requirements
- **File Upload**: Concurrent uploads with progress tracking
- **Metadata Extraction**: Client-side processing to reduce server load
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase subscriptions for live status updates
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching for language/region hierarchies
- **Lazy Loading**: Pagination for large datasets

## User Experience Priorities
1. **Simplicity**: Minimal clicks to complete tasks
2. **Visual Feedback**: Clear progress indicators and status updates
3. **Error Prevention**: Validation at each step
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Supabase RLS policies
- **File Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Upload Limits**: File size and quantity restrictions
- **Data Sanitization**: Input validation and sanitization
- **CORS**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing

## Success Metrics
- **Upload Success Rate**: >99% successful uploads
- **Time to Upload**: <30 seconds for typical audio file
- **User Completion Rate**: >90% complete their upload workflow
- **Error Rate**: <1% unrecoverable errors
- **Performance**: Page load times <2 seconds

## Future Enhancements

- **Collaboration**: Multi-user project access
- **Export Features**: Various format exports
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated audio quality checks 




- website to upload audio files to a postgres supabase db with this schema @database.ts 

technologies
- react
- otherwise, choose what you think is best according to the below requirements

requirements
- as quick and highly performant as possible
- as simple to use as possible

flow - login 
1. login using supabase auth
2. shows a list of user's projects, as well as 'new project'. if user selects a current project, goes to project data

flow - project creation
1. present the user with a heirachical list of language_entities - this should collapse according to the parent heirachy
2. user selects a language entity
3. proceed to the project creation screen - target language entity id already selected in (2), user fills in name, description, selects a source language, user selects a region from a region heirachy (similar to the language heirachies presented), location is automatically taken from the users current location (requests it, if deny then leave this null), created_by, created_at, updated_at are auto filled in, deleted_at is null

flow - project data
1. database-like list of bible books, each expandable into chapters from the books. 
- each chapter row displays the total verse range of that chapter, and its status based on how many verses from that chapter are uploaded. green = fully uploaded, red = not started, orange = partially uploaded 
- when a chapter is expanded, it displays the entries for the media_files which have either start_verse_id or end_verse_id inside that chapter. so the frontend will be able to calculate the 'progress' for a chapter based on the media_files for that chapter and the total verse range for that chapter. the goal is to have all verses in that chapter coered
2. under the bible book database, there is an 'upload audio file' button
3. there is also an 'upload text' button
4. an option to edit the project metadata

flow - audio file uploading
1. drag and drop 1 or more audio files in
2. for each file, try and automatically detect the bible book, chapter, starting verse and ending verse. we can do this by regex parsing the filename, it should be relatively standarised - here is an example of some filenames which we are uploading, which we can base the extraction logic on
Bajhangi_Psalms_Chapter089_V001_026.mp3
Bajhangi_Psalms_Chapter089_V027_052.mp3
Bajhangi_2 Kings_Chapter1.zip
Bajhangi_Song of Solomon_Chapter3.zip
3. for each file, try and automatically detect the verse timestamps, extract these from the ID3 metadata. IF there are verse timestamps, it will be in this format (a bit confusing, but CHAPTER0START is the starting timestamp for verse 1, etc.)

}
4. user is presented with a database-like list of the audio files they just dragged in. each has the detected chapter, and a list of detected verses with timestamps. if the book or chapter of any media file could not be detected, it is highlighted for the user can enter. user can enter the chapter for any of the media files, or change the auto detected ones - these are changed via searchable dropdowns, options taken from the chpaters models. all audio files must have a chapter selected to proceed. for each audio file, user has the option to click 'mark verses', which brings up the verse marking popup
5. user clicks upload and these audio files are uploaded using my upload_audio supabase edge function (@index.ts ). so it should send:
file (i.e. upload the actual file)
language_entity_id - from the project
chapter_id - the selected chapter
start_verse_id - the first marked verse. if no verses marked, then the first verse of the chapter_id
end_verse_id - the last marked verse. if no verses marked, then the first verse of the chapter_id
duration_seconds - the duration of the media file
project_id - the currently open project id

also sends a bunch of partial media_files_verses objects (optional), based on the marked verses
verse_id
start_time_seconds
duration_seconds

flow - verse marking (popup)
1. at the top, a media player for the selected audio file is shown with normal controls (play, skip foward / backward 5 seconds, speed 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x)
2. in the middle, a list of marked verses is shown for that media file - these will be made into media_files_verses. starts off blank if there are no detected verses. these are organised chronologically (i.e. by starting timestamp). the user can edit the starting timestamp of any verse, which may move it up or down the list. only the first verse has an editable number, the rest of the verse numbers are automatically calculated incrementally fromt he first (and updated every time a new verse is added in between). each verse can also be deleted, which affects the numbers but not the timestamps of any of the next verses. the max verses should not exceed the total_verses of that chapter
3. 'mark verse' button - clicking this adds a verse at whatever timestamp the media player is on
4. ok button - closes the popup and saves the marked verses

flow - text uploading
1. prompts the user to enter the name for the text_version and select a bible_version from a dropdown.
2. prompts upload of a csv file
3.  extracts data from that csv file - it should be 2 columns, 1 with the verse and second with the verse text
4. shows the user a preview of extracted data - a database-style table with all verses and corresponding verse texts. any texts for which the verse could not be detected are highlighted. shows the total number of rows in the spreadsheet and the total number of extracted verses
5. user clicks confirm
6. inserts the following records:
text_versions:
id - uuid
language_entity_id - from the current project
bible_version_id - user selcted in (1)
name - user entered in (1)
text_version_source - user_submitted
created_at - now
created_by - auth user
updated_at - now
deleted_at - null

verse_texts (1 for each row of the csv):
id - uuid
verse_id - the verse id taken from the spreadsheet
text_version_id - id of the text version 
verse_text - the verse text taken from the spreadsheet
created_at - now
created_by - auth user
updated_at - now
deleted_at - null

for each verse_texts inserted, it should also get the corresponding media_files_verses for that project, and update the verse_text_id to that verse_text_id just inserted
