# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up project structure and configure Tailwind with Headless UI and Radix [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the component library project with proper folder structure, install necessary dependencies, and configure Tailwind CSS to work with Headless UI and Radix UI primitives.
### Details:
1. Create a new directory structure for the component library following the recommended pattern with separate folders for each component
2. Install core dependencies: @headlessui/react, @radix-ui/react-*, tailwindcss, typescript, react, and react-dom
3. Configure TypeScript with proper tsconfig.json settings for React and component library development
4. Set up Tailwind CSS configuration with extended theme settings for your design system
5. Configure Tailwind to recognize Radix UI's data attributes by adding appropriate patterns to the content array in tailwind.config.js
6. Create a central export file (index.ts) for the component library
7. Set up Storybook for documentation and visual testing
8. Implement a basic CI workflow for testing components
9. Test the configuration by creating a simple component that uses both Tailwind and one of the UI libraries

## Implementation Details for Form Components

### Component Architecture
- Implemented compound component pattern using React Context for state sharing between parent and child components
- Used TypeScript discriminated unions for prop types to ensure type safety across variants
- Leveraged React.forwardRef for all components to maintain ref forwarding compatibility

### Accessibility Implementation
- Added aria-invalid, aria-describedby, and aria-errormessage attributes dynamically based on validation state
- Implemented focus management with useId() for guaranteed unique identifiers
- Added support for reduced motion preferences using CSS media queries
- Included high contrast mode considerations for Windows users

### Technical Specifics
```tsx
// Example implementation of FormField context
const FormFieldContext = React.createContext<FormFieldContextValue>({} as FormFieldContextValue)

export const FormField = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, FormFieldProps>(
  ({ name, children, ...props }, ref) => {
    const id = React.useId()
    const { control, formState } = useFormContext()
    const { errors } = formState
    
    const error = get(errors, name)
    const errorMessage = error?.message as string
    
    const contextValue = React.useMemo(
      () => ({ id, name, formItemId: `${id}-form-item`, formDescriptionId: `${id}-form-description`, formMessageId: `${id}-form-message`, errorMessage }),
      [id, name, errorMessage]
    )
    
    return (
      <FormFieldContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
        <div ref={ref} {...props}>
          {children}
        </div>
      </FormFieldContext.Provider>
    )
  }
)
```

### Performance Optimizations
