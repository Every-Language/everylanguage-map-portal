# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Filename Parsing Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create robust filename parsing to automatically detect book, chapter, and verse information.
# Details:
Implement RegEx patterns for common filename formats: Language_Book_Chapter###_V###_###.mp3, Language_Book_Chapter#.zip, etc. Create a service to extract book, chapter, and verse information from filenames. Handle edge cases and partial matches. Provide fallback UI for manual entry when automatic detection fails.

# Test Strategy:
Test parsing with various filename formats. Verify that edge cases are handled correctly. Test the fallback manual entry interface.
