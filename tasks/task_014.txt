# Description: Build a custom HTML5 audio player with precise timestamp controls for verse marking.
# Details:
Create a custom audio player using HTML5 Audio API. Implement controls: play/pause, skip Â±5s, playback speed (0.5x-4x). Add current timestamp display. Implement keyboard shortcuts (spacebar, arrow keys). Style with Tailwind CSS for a consistent look. Make the player responsive for different screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Test all player controls. Verify that keyboard shortcuts work correctly. Test on different browsers and devices. Ensure the player is accessible.
