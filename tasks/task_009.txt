# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement File Upload Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a drag-and-drop interface for multi-file audio uploads with preview.
# Details:
Build a drag-and-drop zone supporting multiple files. Implement file type validation for audio formats (mp3, m4a, wav). Add file size and format checks. Create a file preview list with basic metadata. Implement file removal functionality. Add fallback for browsers without drag-and-drop support.

# Test Strategy:
Test drag-and-drop functionality with various file types. Verify that invalid files are rejected with appropriate error messages. Test the file preview and removal functionality.
