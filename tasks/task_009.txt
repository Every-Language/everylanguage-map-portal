# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a drag-and-drop interface for multi-file audio uploads with preview.
# Details:
Successfully implemented a comprehensive drag-and-drop zone supporting multiple audio files with the following features:

- Audio format validation for mp3, m4a, wav, aac, ogg, and webm
- File size limits (500MB max per file, 50 files max per session)
- Detailed file preview list with metadata extraction using HTML5 Audio API
- Individual file removal with confirmation
- Fallback click-to-browse functionality for browsers without drag-and-drop support
- Intelligent filename parsing to detect book/chapter information
- Real-time upload statistics and progress tracking
- Integrated AudioPlayer component for file preview
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed messages

Implemented in the AudioUploadPage Component (`src/features/upload/pages/AudioUploadPage.tsx`) with proper routing integration at `/upload` and dashboard navigation.

# Test Strategy:
Tested drag-and-drop functionality with various file types. Verified rejection of invalid files with appropriate error messages. Confirmed file preview and removal functionality works correctly. Validated metadata extraction accuracy and filename parsing patterns. Tested browser fallback functionality and responsive design across devices. Verified upload progress indicators and statistics dashboard functionality.
