# Title: Develop Timeline Editor for Verse Segments
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a visual timeline representation of verse segments within the audio file.
# Details:
Build a visual timeline component showing the audio waveform (if possible) or time segments. Display verse markers on the timeline. Allow clicking on the timeline to navigate to that position. Implement dragging verse markers to adjust timestamps. Ensure the timeline is synchronized with the audio player. Add visual indicators for verse coverage and gaps.

# Test Strategy:
Test timeline navigation by clicking. Verify that verse markers are correctly positioned. Test dragging markers to adjust timestamps. Ensure the timeline stays synchronized with the audio player.
