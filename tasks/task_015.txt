# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Verse Marking Modal
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a modal interface for marking verse timestamps in audio files.
# Details:
Build a modal component for verse marking. Integrate the custom audio player. Create a chronologically ordered verse list with editable start times. Implement auto-reordering when times are edited. Add delete functionality for verse markers. Implement a 'Mark Verse' button that adds a verse at the current timestamp. Add validation against chapter.total_verses.

# Test Strategy:
Test adding, editing, and deleting verse markers. Verify that auto-reordering works correctly. Test validation against chapter verse counts. Ensure the modal is accessible.
