# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Project Creation Flow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the project creation interface with hierarchical language and region selection.
# Details:
Create a multi-step form for project creation. Implement hierarchical tree view for language_entities selection with collapsible parent-child relationships. Add search functionality for quick navigation. Build form with auto-populated fields (name, description, source language, region). Implement geolocation detection for location field. Set up validation and database insertion logic.

# Test Strategy:

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement multi-step form structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for the project creation flow using a stepper/wizard pattern with proper state management and navigation between steps.
### Details:
1. Set up a stepper component with 4 steps: Project Info, Language Selection, Region Selection, and Confirmation.
2. Implement state management for form data using React Context or Redux (for React) or Pinia/Vuex (for Vue).
3. Create navigation controls (Previous/Next buttons) with proper validation to prevent progression without required fields.
4. Add progress indicators to show users where they are in the flow (applying Goal-Gradient Effect).
5. Ensure the form structure is responsive and accessible with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
6. Test the navigation flow between steps and verify state persistence when moving between steps.

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
- Implemented using a recursive tree structure where each node renders its children
- Used React's `useReducer` for local tree state management (expanded nodes, selected node)
- Leveraged CSS Grid for alignment of tree items with proper indentation

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented virtualization for large language lists using `react-window`
- Added lazy loading of child nodes only when parent is expanded
- Memoized tree nodes with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Debounced search input to prevent excessive API calls

### Accessibility Enhancements
- Added `role="tree"` to container and `role="treeitem"` to nodes
- Implemented `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-level` attributes
- Added focus management system that maintains focus when expanding/collapsing
- Implemented keyboard shortcuts:
  ```
  ArrowRight: Expand node
  ArrowLeft: Collapse node or move to parent
  Home: Move to first node
  End: Move to last node
  ```

### Search Implementation
- Built fuzzy search algorithm that matches partial terms
- Added highlighting of matched text in search results
- Implemented path-based search that shows parent nodes when child matches

### Code Example for Node Rendering
```tsx
const TreeNode = ({ 
  node, 
  level, 
  isExpanded, 
  isSelected, 
  onToggle, 
  onSelect 
}) => {
  const hasChildren = node.children?.length > 0;
  
  return (
    <div 
      role="treeitem"
      aria-expanded={hasChildren ? isExpanded : undefined}
      aria-selected={isSelected}
      aria-level={level}
      className={`tree-node ${isSelected ? 'selected' : ''}`}
      tabIndex={isSelected ? 0 : -1}
    >
      <div className="node-content" style={{ paddingLeft: `${level * 16}px` }}>
        {hasChildren && (
          <button 
            className="toggle-button"
            onClick={() => onToggle(node.id)}
            aria-label={isExpanded ? "Collapse" : "Expand"}
          >
            {isExpanded ? <ChevronDown size={16} /> : <ChevronRight size={16} />}
          </button>
        )}
        <span onClick={() => onSelect(node.id)}>{node.name}</span>
      </div>
      
      {hasChildren && isExpanded && (
        <div role="group">
          {node.children.map(child => (
            <TreeNode 
              key={child.id}
              node={child}
              level={level + 1}
              /* other props */
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Testing Strategy
- Created unit tests with Jest/React Testing Library for component behavior
- Added specific tests for keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Implemented snapshot tests for visual regression

## 3. Implement search functionality for language/region selection [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Add search capabilities to quickly filter and find languages and regions in the hierarchical selection component.
### Details:
1. Create a search input field above the language/region tree view.
2. Implement real-time filtering logic that narrows down options as the user types.
3. Highlight matching text in search results for better visibility.
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation (e.g., pressing 'S' focuses the search field).
5. Implement clear button and escape key functionality to reset search.
6. Ensure the search works across both language names and region names.
7. Add empty state messaging when no results match the search criteria.
8. Test search functionality with various inputs including partial matches, case sensitivity, and special characters.

## 4. Create auto-populated form fields with geolocation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement form fields for project details with auto-population capabilities and geolocation detection for the location field.
### Details:
1. Create form fields for project name, description, source language, and region.
2. Implement client-side geolocation detection using the browser's Geolocation API.
3. Add fallback mechanisms when geolocation is denied or unavailable.
4. Create logic to auto-populate fields based on user profile data or previous selections.
5. Implement debounced auto-save functionality to preserve user input.
6. Add field-level validation with appropriate error messages.
7. Ensure all fields are properly labeled and accessible.
8. Test form behavior with various input scenarios and geolocation permissions states.

Here's additional implementation information for the geolocation form fields task:

```typescript
// Geolocation implementation with reverse geocoding
const detectUserLocation = async () => {
  setLocationLoading(true);
  try {
    // Get coordinates from browser API
    const position = await new Promise<GeolocationPosition>((resolve, reject) => {
      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject, {
        enableHighAccuracy: true,
        timeout: 5000,
        maximumAge: 0
      });
    });
    
    const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
    
    // Reverse geocode coordinates to human-readable location
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.bigdatacloud.net/data/reverse-geocode-client?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&localityLanguage=en`
    );
    
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Geocoding API error');
    
    const data = await response.json();
    const locationString = [
      data.city,
      data.principalSubdivision,
      data.countryName
    ].filter(Boolean).join(', ');
    
    dispatch({
      type: 'UPDATE_PROJECT_INFO',
      payload: { location: locationString }
    });
    
    setLocationDetected(true);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Geolocation error:', error);
    setLocationError(
      error.code === 1 
        ? 'Location access denied. Please enable location permissions or enter manually.'
        : 'Unable to detect location. Please enter manually.'
    );
  } finally {
    setLocationLoading(false);
  }
};

// Debounced auto-save implementation
const debouncedSave = useCallback(
  debounce((field: string, value: string) => {
    dispatch({
      type: 'UPDATE_PROJECT_INFO',
      payload: { [field]: value }
    });
  }, 500),
  []
);

// Form field accessibility enhancements
const formFields = [
  {
    id: 'project-name',
    label: 'Project Name',
    required: true,
    helperText: 'Enter a descriptive name for your translation project',
    inputProps: {
      'aria-required': 'true',
      'aria-describedby': 'project-name-helper-text'
    }
  },
  // Additional field configurations...
];
```

For fallback mechanisms:
- Implement a manual location entry field that appears when geolocation fails
- Store user's previous locations in localStorage for quick selection
- Add a dropdown with common regions based on user's IP geolocation as fallback
- Include clear error states with actionable messages for permission issues

For validation:
- Implement progressive validation that validates fields only after first interaction
- Add specific validation rules for project names (no special characters, min/max length)
- Include language compatibility checks between source and target languages
