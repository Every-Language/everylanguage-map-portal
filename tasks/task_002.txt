# Task ID: 2
# Title: Integrate Supabase Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase client and implement authentication flows including login, registration, and session management.
# Details:
Install Supabase JS client. Create authentication service with login, logout, register, and password reset functions. Implement persistent session storage. Create login and registration forms with validation. Set up protected routes using React Router. Implement role-based access control using Supabase RLS policies.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, logout, and session persistence. Verify that protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login page.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Supabase client and environment configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Supabase client with proper environment variables and create a centralized configuration file for authentication services.
### Details:
1. Install required dependencies: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
2. Create environment variables in `.env` file for Supabase URL and anon key (use appropriate prefix like REACT_APP_ or NEXT_PUBLIC_ depending on your framework)
3. Create a `supabaseClient.js` file that initializes the Supabase client using environment variables
4. Add proper error handling for initialization failures
5. Set up CORS configuration in Supabase dashboard to whitelist your frontend domain
6. Test the connection by making a simple query
7. Document the setup process for other developers

Testing approach: Verify client initialization works without errors and can make a basic public query to Supabase.

## 2. Implement authentication service with core functions [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a dedicated authentication service that handles login, registration, logout, and password reset functionality using the Supabase client.
### Details:
1. Create an `authService.js` file that imports the Supabase client
2. Implement the following functions with proper error handling:
   - `signUp(email, password)` - User registration
   - `signIn(email, password)` - User login with credentials
   - `signInWithProvider(provider)` - OAuth login (if needed)
   - `signOut()` - User logout
   - `resetPassword(email)` - Password reset request
   - `updatePassword(password)` - Update password after reset
3. Add appropriate validation for inputs
4. Include comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages
5. Add logging for authentication events (for debugging)

Testing approach: Create unit tests for each authentication function using a testing framework like Jest, mocking the Supabase responses. Test both success and error scenarios.

## 3. Create authentication context and session management [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement a global authentication context using React Context API to manage user session state throughout the application.
### Details:
1. Create an `AuthContext.js` file with React Context API
2. Implement an AuthProvider component that:
   - Maintains current user state
   - Listens to auth state changes using `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange`
   - Provides methods to access the current user and authentication status
   - Handles session persistence across page refreshes
3. Create a custom hook `useAuth()` to easily access auth context
4. Implement session retrieval on initial load using `supabase.auth.getSession()`
5. Add proper cleanup for auth listeners when components unmount
6. Handle token refresh logic to maintain long-lived sessions

Testing approach: Test the AuthProvider with React Testing Library to ensure it correctly updates state on auth events and provides the expected context values.

## 4. Build login and registration forms with validation [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create user-friendly login and registration forms with proper validation, error handling, and user feedback.
### Details:
1. Create reusable form components for:
   - Login form with email/password fields
   - Registration form with necessary fields
   - Password reset request form
   - Password update form
2. Implement form validation using a library like Formik or React Hook Form
3. Add validation rules for:
   - Email format
   - Password strength (min length, complexity)
   - Required fields
4. Connect forms to the authentication service methods
5. Implement proper loading states during authentication
6. Display user-friendly error messages from Supabase
7. Add success feedback and redirects after successful operations

Testing approach: Test form validation logic, submission handling, and UI state changes during authentication processes using component testing.

## 5. Implement protected routes and role-based access control [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Set up route protection using React Router and implement role-based access control using Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
### Details:
1. Create a `ProtectedRoute` component that:
   - Checks for authenticated user using the auth context
   - Redirects to login page if user is not authenticated
   - Optionally checks for specific user roles
2. Implement route configuration using React Router with protected routes
3. Set up Supabase RLS policies for your database tables:
   - Enable RLS on all sensitive tables
   - Create policies that restrict access based on user authentication
   - Add role-specific policies for different access levels
4. Test RLS policies to ensure they correctly restrict unauthorized access
5. Create helper functions to check user permissions in the UI
6. Implement UI elements that conditionally render based on user roles

Testing approach: Test protected routes by simulating authenticated and unauthenticated states. Verify RLS policies by attempting to access data with different user roles and ensuring proper restrictions are in place.
