# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Caching and Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 8, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize application performance with caching strategies and lazy loading.
# Details:
Implement aggressive caching for language/region hierarchies. Add pagination for large datasets. Optimize component rendering with React.memo and useMemo. Implement code splitting for large components. Add lazy loading for images and non-critical resources. Set up performance monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare load times before and after optimizations. Test pagination with large datasets. Verify that caching works correctly. Use React DevTools to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.
