# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Database Schema and Supabase Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Supabase database with all required tables according to the schema specification.
# Details:
The Supabase database has been successfully set up with all required tables: projects, language_entities, regions, bible_versions, books, chapters, verses, media_files, media_files_verses, media_files_targets, text_versions, verse_texts, users. Foreign key relationships have been established. The @everylanguage/shared-types package has been integrated, providing auto-generated TypeScript types for the database. Connection is working properly with environment variables configured in .env.remote.dev. All database tables are available and properly typed.

# Test Strategy:
Database schema has been verified with all tables created with correct columns and relationships. Connection to the database has been tested and is working properly. TypeScript types from @everylanguage/shared-types package have been confirmed to correctly match the database schema.
